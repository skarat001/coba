--------------------

devote yourself to crushing dreams and ideals
I rip out your mask of lies now
an ache lodges in my back, dancing and flirting
a rotting heart began to pulse...

an impulse to shiver until my eardrums burst
"you drive me completely mad!" my throbbing becomes violent
with your twisted ideals... show! reveal yourself!

Don't hide anymore! feel you... SIXty∞NINe...
Bustard lame faker... feel you.... nasty dance...

like moonlight on velvet, the colour of your red dirty blood hotly boiling
like delusions being stained blacker, so is the meaning of your life with unfading sin

Don't hide anymore! feel you... SIXty∞NINe...
Bustard lame faker... feel you.... nasty dance...

stardust dances a rondo, till the dancing darkness breaks down you're burdened with your unerasable sins
like a heroine of your own movie, you conceal your invisible wound and laugh, like you're casting off skin
a rondo of sinners, let's play a song of the moon and pity... lighting our way to tomorrow...
