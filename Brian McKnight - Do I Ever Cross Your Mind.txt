Title: Do I Ever Cross Your Mind

I cant remember why we fell apart

From something that was so meant to be

Forever was the promise in our hearts

Now more and more I wonder where you are…

Chorus:

Do I ever cross your mind (anytime?)

Do you ever wake up reaching out for me

Do I ever cross your mind (anytime?)

I miss you

Still have your picture in a frame

I hear your footsteps down the hall

I swear I hear your voice, driving me insane

How I wish that you would call to say …

Chorus:

Do I ever cross your mind (anytime?)

Do you ever wake up reaching out for me

Do I ever cross your mind (anytime?)

I miss you,

I miss you,

I miss you

No more… loneliness and heartache

No more… crying myself to sleep

No more… wondering about tomorrow

Wont you come back to me (come back to me)

Ooohhh woo ooo

Repeat Chorus (2X)
