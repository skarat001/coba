Title: Start Over

This is the day we open your eyes
This world tries to keep us in chains
Telling us what’s right and what’s wrong
Well ain’t nobody gonna teach you, yeah

I’m on a mission to respond
I’m gonna tear this system apart
Design a new path for a soul
Where we can follow our hearts
No one should hold us down (No one should hold us down)

Let every single breath help to set us free, to shut down the system, start over
And even if the world seems to disagree just shut down the system, start over

Let every step that we take be an experiment in faith
Because the greatest risk in life is to take no risk at all
No one should hold us down (No one should hold us down)

Let every single breath help to set us free, to shut down the system, start over
And even if the world seems to disagree just shut down the system, start over

Over, Over, Over, Over

Don’t let society tell you that your goals ain’t right
That you’re
Cause we all got something to give
Everybody’s different
Give em hell, Give em hell, Give em hell

No one should hold us down (No one should hold us down)
Let every single breath help to set us free, start over
Let every single breath help to set us free, to shut down the system, start over
And even if the world seems to disagree just shut down the system, start over
Let every single breath help to set us free, just shut down the system, start over
