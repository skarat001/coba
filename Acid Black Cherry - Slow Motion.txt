Music by Takao Kisugi

Suna no ue kizamu [SUTEPPU] hon no hitori asobi
Furimuku to tooku hitokage nagisa wo kaketekuru

Fui ni sesuji wo nukete koi no yokan amaku hashitta

Deai wa [SUROMOOSHOON]
Karui memai sasou hodo ni
Deai wa [SUROMOOSHOON]
Hitomi no naka utsuru hito

[SUTORAIDO] nagai ashisaki yukkuri yogitteku
Sono ato wo kakeru [SHEPAADO] kuchibue fuku anata

Natsu no koibito kouho arawareta no konna hayaku ni

Deai wa [SUROMOOSHOON]
Kokoro dake ga sakibashiri ne
Deai wa [SUROMOOSHOON]
Kawasu kotoba ni kanjiru wa

Deai wa [SUROMOOSHOON]
Koi no keshiki yuruyaka da wa
Deai wa [SUROMOOSHOON]
Koi no sokudo yuruyaka ni

Suna no ue kizamu [SUTEPPU] ima anata to tomo ni

On the sand with dainty steps just playing alone
When I looked back, a faraway shadow was running on the water's edge

Suddenly, my back stiffened, and I ran innocently toward the premonition of love

Our meeting is in slow motion
Enough as to invite slight vertigo in me
Our meeting is in slow motion
The person reflected in the depths of my eyes

The strides of your long legs slowly catching up to me
You're whistling, a shepherd urging me to follow

A candidate for my summer lover, appearing so quickly...

Our meeting is in slow motion
Only your heart is bold, I see
Your love motion
I can feel it in the words we share

Our meeting is in slow motion
The affairs of passion are forgiving, you know
Our meeting is in slow motion
In the indulgent swiftness of our passion

On the sand with dainty steps...now I'm together with you
