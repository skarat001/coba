[00:09.79]Remember again
[00:11.97]
[00:32.29]Inside a world of broken words you cannot hide
[00:42.41]You try to find the reasons why, as days collide
[00:50.10]
[00:51.41]The seconds keep on passing, without a sound, you turn around
[00:56.69]And as you walk away I call to you
[01:00.60]
[01:00.78]Don't you let go
[01:03.15]Take a look around, you are not alone
[01:05.81]If you'd only stop and close your eyes
[01:08.40]Find the answers, you'd find the answers
[01:11.07]When you feel like the world if falling in
[01:13.98]And you can't seem to find the way back in
[01:16.16]Don't cry
[01:18.95]Just hear these words and remember again
[01:21.82]
[01:33.36]Outside, you're trembling as you stand, in the falling rain
[01:42.93]You try to find where you belong, as you drown the pain
[01:49.57]
[01:52.06]You hear the voices crying inside a world monochrome
[01:57.30]But their eyes are bleeding tears of magenta
[02:01.34]
[02:01.51]Don't you let go
[02:03.88]Take another breath when you're lost again
[02:06.61]If you'd only break the walls within
[02:09.21]Find the courage, you'd find the courage
[02:13.00]When you feel like the world if falling in
[02:14.17]And you can't seem to find the way back in
[02:16.85]Don't cry
[02:19.52]Just hear these words and remember again
[02:22.71]
[02:22.91]Another silent prayer fades as the night slips past
[02:33.80]I try to reach out to the light through the glass as it shatters
[02:42.53]
[03:20.44]Don't you let go
[03:22.93]Take a look around, you are not alone
[03:25.53]If you'd only stop and close your eyes
[03:28.20]Find the answers, you'd find the answers
[03:30.44]When you feel like the world if falling in
[03:33.41]And you can't seem to find the way back in
[03:35.85]Don't cry
[03:38.32]Just hear these words and remember
[03:40.42]
[03:40.68]Don't you let go
[03:43.11]Take another breath when you're lost again
[03:45.52]If you'd only break the walls within
[03:48.14]Find the courage, you'd find the courage
[03:50.57]When you feel like the world if falling in
[03:53.48]And you can't seem to find the way back in
[03:55.90]Don't cry
[03:58.58]Just hear these words and remember again
